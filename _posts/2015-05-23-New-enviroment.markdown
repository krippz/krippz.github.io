Hmm it's been a while since my last post, can't seem to get a good workflow for posting.

Since the last post the ASP.NET team has released beta4 and are working on beta 5. Looking forward to that!

Well I have gone back to work since my last post, this might have played a small role in the lack of posts.

I have a new enviroment setup at work, I have switched to running Ubuntu native and Win 8.1 in a virtual machine. It's a laptop so I had some problems with the multimonitor setup I use at work. Seems to work fine now after some tweaks. Still working on getting a custom keyboard layout working....

xkb is a pain to understand.
