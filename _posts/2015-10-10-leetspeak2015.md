So this year leetspeak is held in my home town of Stockholm! It's kicked off in an awsome way! I really enjoy the atmosphere here. This year's conference is held at Berns here in Stockholm. *Really* fancy stage and a fun place to be :) with fancy beeing the style of the stage.

Oh and the swag table was really good! I have picked up some nice stickers!


People are really friendy and talkative, as I would expect :) I will probably fill my head with lots of differnt bits and pices of information. Hoping to talk to some of the presenters later this afternoon.
